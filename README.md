# Flea market

The main purpose of Flea Market is to help people to stay more organized using our To Do List and Habit Tracker. Moreover, our team wanted to create a product which would include other useful things like weather, etc. on one website. Flea Market was built on JavaScript with React usage. Also we were curious about other technologies, so we tried several public APIs.
